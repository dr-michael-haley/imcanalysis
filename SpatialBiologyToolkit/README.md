# SpatialBiologyToolkit

Core Python package for IMC / spatial-omics analysis. The notebooks and SLURM jobs wrap functions from this package.

## Layout
- `population_identification.py`, `backgating.py`: clustering, annotation, and gating helpers for cell phenotyping.
- `spatial.py` plus `spatialstats/`: spatial statistics, pair-correlation and neighbourhood tools (SpOOx utilities are vendored in `spatialstats/`).
- `plotting.py`: figure utilities shared by notebooks and scripts.
- `image_analysis.py`, `denoising.py`, `imc_import_*.py`, `visium.py`: image IO, denoising, and Visium/spatial transcriptomics bridges.
- `scripts/`: CLI-style pipeline stages (see `scripts/README.md`).
- `utils.py`: shared helpers.

## Install locally
1. Create/activate the conda env (see `Conda_environments/conda_environment.yml`).
2. From the repo root run `pip install -e .`.
3. Most scripts read a `config.yaml` generated by `scripts/generate_config.py` or by the `job_config` SLURM stage in your working folder.

## Where to go next
- Notebooks for exploratory analysis: `Tutorials/`.
- SLURM job wrappers for running stages on HPC: `SLURM_scripts/`.
- Convenience commands for submitting or checking pipelines: `Bash_scripts/`.
