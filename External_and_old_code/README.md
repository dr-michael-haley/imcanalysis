## 🌟 IMC_Denoise (Updated November 2024)

This notebook has largerly been superceded by CSF3-compatible denoising scripts. The original notebook implementation of [IMC Denoise](https://github.com/PENGLU-WashU/IMC_Denoise/)—designed to integrate with the Bodenmiller pipeline—is still available in the repo, but we now recommend running denoising on CSF3 for best results.

## 🧬 REDSEA (Cell Segmentation Overlap Correction) (Updated 4th November 2022)

This tool is adapted from the original [REDSEA implementation](https://github.com/labsyspharm/redseapy) by Artem Sokolov, reworked for better integration with the Bodenmiller pipeline. Our testing indicates that it doesn't work particularly well, often losing so much positive signal that the signal to noise ratio is barely improved. Still, I've left it here just in case.

This is a dumping ground for a lot of old code, most of which has been integrated into the SpatialBiologyToolkit package
