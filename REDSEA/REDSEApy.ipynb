    "# <font color='red'> REDSEA </font>with Bodenmiller Pipeline \n",
    "#### Adapted by Michael Haley and Antonn Cheeseman, last updated 4th November 2022\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook integrates the REDSEA algorithm (https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2021.652631/full) converted into Python by Artem Sokolov (https://github.com/labsyspharm/redseapy) into the Bodenmiller pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "This replaces the last CellProfiler step in the Bodenmiller pipeline that would normally extract the single cell expression of each of the markers and create a cell table .csv file. This notebook similarly extracts the single-cell information, but also does the REDSEA compensation for any cells in which the cells are in direct cell-to-cell contact. This is particularly useful for very dense tissues where segmentation is difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "This should run in the same environment as you use for other IMC analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### You need to specify the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **image_folder** - These are the image 'full stacks' created by the second-to-last CellProfiler step in the Bodenmiller pipeline. They should be called something like *ROIname_s0_a1_ac_full.tif*. There should be one per ROI.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **segmentation_masks** - These are the segementation masks created by the second-to-last CellProfiler step in the Bodenmiller pipeline. They should be called something like *ROIname_s0_a1_ac_ilastik_Probabilities_mask.tif*. There should be one per ROI, they should match up with the images if you have used the Bodemiller pipeline correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **markers** - This is a .csv file with one column which details the exact order and names of the markers as they appear in the image stacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **output_folder** - The folder where the .csv file will be saved. Two .csv files, one REDSEA corrected (corrected_celltable.csv) and one uncorrected (uncorrected_celltable.csv).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The following are options:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **excluded_markers** - **['DNA1','DNA3']** by default, which will do compensation on all the markers apart from DNA markers. If you supply a list of markers, then it exclude them from analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **markers_of_interest** - *None* by default, but if *excluded_markers* is also set to *None*, will only do compensation on the supplied list of markers. If both excluded_markers and markers_of_interest are *None*, then will do all markers (incuding DNA). \n",
    "\n",
    "> **save_individual** - *False* by default, if *True* will save cell table for each ROI separately, as well as combining\n"
