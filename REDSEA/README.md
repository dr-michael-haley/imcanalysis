## REDSEA adaptation to Bodemiller Pipeline
*Last updated 4th Nov 2022 by Michael Haley*

This has been adapted by Michael Haley from the code originally written by Artem Sokolov (https://github.com/labsyspharm/redseapy) to help better integration into the Bodenmiller pipeline

Our results with this were mixed, though it did work. The problem we encountered was that is reduced the signal noticably on all cell. So, we may have lost contaminating spill over, but also lost specific signal which meant the overall signal:noise ratio wasn't hugely improved.
