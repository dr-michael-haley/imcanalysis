## Mike_IMC_Denoise.ipynb
This is a Jupyter notebook that implements the IMC Denoise approach (https://github.com/PENGLU-WashU/IMC_Denoise/, https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.21.501021v1) to marry up with the Bodenmiller IMC pipeline.

Running it will require  a computer with a good GPU / graphics card, and will also require it to be compatible with the packages that IMCDenoise uses (e.g. specific version of TensorFlow, Keras and Python, all of which are a bit out of date in the IMC Denoise repository on which I've based everything).

Underdoing testing as we speak!
