## Mike_IMC_Pipeline - last updated 21st Sept 2022
This is the latest iteration of my Python pipeline for IMC analysis, which includes some basic details on how to get setup the Conda environment and get started. This is a work in progress, and should be treated as such.

## Mike_IMC_Denoise.ipynb
This is a Jupyter notebook that implements the IMC Denoise approach (https://github.com/PENGLU-WashU/IMC_Denoise/, https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.21.501021v1) to marry up with the Bodenmiller IMC pipeline.

Running it will require  a computer with a good GPU / graphics card, and will also require it to be compatible with the packages that IMCDenoise uses (e.g. specific version of TensorFlow, Keras and Python, all of which are a bit out of date in the IMC Denoise repository on which I've based everything).

Underdoing testing as we speak!
