# Documentation sources

Sphinx sources for the project documentation. Build outputs live in `Documentation/` (already contains a generated copy).

- Source files are under `docs/source/`.
- Dependencies are listed in `docs/requirements.txt`.
- Build locally with `make html` from this folder (or `make.bat html` on Windows).
- Edit the sources here rather than the generated HTML in `Documentation/`.

The current docs pre-date some recent scripts; treat them as reference until refreshed.
