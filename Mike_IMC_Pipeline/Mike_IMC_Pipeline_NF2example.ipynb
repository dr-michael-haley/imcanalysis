    "When we do analyses in Python, it is important to understand *where* and *how* our data is being stored. Simply, there are 3 different places that our analyses may exist, potentially all at the same time:\n",

    "#### The Python kernel\n",
    "This is the instance of Python that you are currrently working in. It has all the variables and objects you have currently defined stored in the memory, allowing us to access and work with them. However, if we close the kernel, or it crashes, **we lose all our analyses!** Usually we can just re-run all the analyses again without an issue, but it's time consuming and annoying. If the browser crashes, that is not an issue - just reopen the browser,  go back to the Jupyter web page (look in your browser 'history' to find the address), and you should be able to pick up where you left off. However, in order to keep Jupyter and the kernel running, do not close the Anaconda prompt you used to start Jupyter, or turn off your computer\n",

    "#### The Jupyter notebook file (.ipynb)\n",
    "This stores all your **markdown, code and the outputs** of any analyses you have run - essentially, **if you can see it visually on screen it will be saved in the Jupyter notebook file!**. Jupyter will automaticlaly save periodically. However, if you rerun cells, you lose any previous outputs, unless you have saved them to disk...\n",

    "#### Adata object saved on disk\n",

    "In their original deﬁnition, all entropic scores described above do not take the spatial component into account when calculated on a whole tumor level. For this reason, ATHENA implements two ﬂavors of these scores: a global ﬂavor, in which the metrics are computed at a whole sample level using only the phenotype distribution, and a local ﬂavor, in which the scores are computed at a single-cell level, using also the graph structure. Speciﬁcally, when computing local scores, ATHENA iterates over all cells, and for each cell, computes the local entropy within its neighborhood. In this way, highly diverse regions where cells from multiple diferent phenotypes coexist can be highlighted, and, instead of computing a single entropy value as for the global ﬂavor, a distribution of entropic values is returned.\n",

To apply these scores to the data we use again .metrics but this time with local=True. Since these scores heavily depend on the tumor topology, the graph type and occasionally additional parameters also need to be provided."
