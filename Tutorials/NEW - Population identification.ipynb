    "The first major step in analyzing Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) data is to identify the cell populations present in your samples. In this notebook, we use an approach adapted from single-cell RNA sequencing: unsupervised clustering using the Leiden algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leiden clustering allows us to detect both abundant and rare populations without providing prior knowledge to the algorithm. It groups cells based on patterns in their marker expression, and returns numbered clusters—e.g., *0*, *1*, etc.—with lower numbers typically representing more abundant populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, these clusters need to be biologically interpreted and labeled. That is, we must assign each numbered cluster to a known or hypothesized cell type (e.g., macrophages, T cells, fibroblasts). This process is crucial for all downstream analyses—and while it's powerful, it's also inherently subjective and sometimes challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Challenges in Labeling Cell Populations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clusters rarely align perfectly with known cell types**  \n",
    "   Some clusters may actually consist of multiple subpopulations, while others may represent duplicates of the same biological population.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Rare or unexpected populations**  \n",
    "   You might discover unexpected cell types or odd marker combinations. These require careful interpretation, possibly informed by external datasets like scRNA-seq or FACS. There are also common artifacts that occur in IMC and similar antibody based approaches that we must look out for: Tears or damage to the tissue, antibodies binding non-specifically, or cell segmentation bringing in markers from neighbouring cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Marker limitations**  \n",
    "   Your ability to distinguish between cell types depends entirely on the markers included in your panel, and the quality (i.e. signal-to-noise) present in individual markers. A poorly designed panel limits interpretability. We do not have the luxury of thousands of genes to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **QC is essential**  \n",
    "   Mislabeling clusters can lead to misleading or invalid downstream results. It’s extremely important to validate each cell label using multiple views of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Strategies and Quality Control (QC)\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve accuracy and confidence in your labels, we apply multiple **QC strategies**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **UMAP Plots**  \n",
    "  Cells with similar marker profiles should group closely together. If a cluster appears scattered or mixed, it may need to be split or re-evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Heatmaps**  \n",
    "  These show the average marker expression per cluster. They help you recognize population-specific patterns and validate labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Spatial mapping and backgating**  \n",
    "  Visualizing labeled populations back in the tissue provides a powerful reality check. For example, if Cluster 4 looks like a macrophage on your heatmap and UMAP, it should *look like* a macrophage in the tissue too.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reference Datasets** *(not covered here)*\n",
    "  Comparing your results to published single-cell RNA-seq or IMC datasets can aid biological interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 Why This Step Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting this stage right is **critical**. Every downstream analysis—from spatial patterning to statistical comparison—relies on the accuracy of your cell population labels. Mislabeling can invalidate results and, in some cases, require redoing all downstream steps. This is one of the most subjective parts of the analysis pipeline. Everything that follows is typically more linear and reproducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Beyond Unsupervised Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "While this notebook focuses on **unsupervised clustering**, there are alternative strategies (e.g., manual gating similar to FACS), where cells are assigned to populations using expression thresholds. These methods can be more transparent but are often impractical with large marker panels like those in IMC data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also **semi-supervised** and **automated** methods to assist with labeling, though these are outside the scope of this notebook.\n"

    "This notebook breaks some of the typical rules of structured programming. Rather than expecting you to run all cells in order from top to bottom, it is designed as a toolbox - a collection of useful functions and workflows that you can use as needed, in an iterative and interactive way.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will provide you with the tools to...\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assigning labels to Leiden clusters  \n",
    "- Performing key QC checks (UMAP, heatmap, tissue mapping)  \n",
    "- Adjusting clusters (splitting or merging) as needed  \n",
    "- Validating your final labeled populations\n",
    "\n",
    "You will likely find yourself jumping back and forth between tools (clustering, quality control, merging populations, and more) until you arrive at a set of biologically meaningful populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔁 An Iterative Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Labeling cell populations is (initially!) not a linear task. Instead, the real-world process often looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run unsupervised (e.g. Leiden) clustering\n",
    "2. Try to interpret the biological meaning of each cluster\n",
    "3. Run quality control checks\n",
    "4. Split or merge populations based on what you observe\n",
    "5. Repeat…\n",
    "\n",
    "Some clusters may contain more than one biological subtype and should be split; others may represent the same biology and should be merged. Each time you modify the clusters, you need to rerun QC to ensure the labels still make sense across:\n",
    "- UMAP\n",
    "- Heatmaps\n",
    "- Spatial backgating\n",
    "\n",
    "This cycle continues until you are confident that your annotations are as accurate and interpretable as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✍️ Suggested Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you're comfortable with the tools and understand how and when to use each one, consider creating your own notebook that reuses parts of this code in a logical order. Be sure to:\n",
    "- Add lots of notes and comments\n",
    "- Save intermediate outputs\n",
    "- Clearly track which parameters and logic you used\n",
    "\n",
    "This will give you a permanent, reproducible record of how you defined your populations which will be absolutely necessary when writing papers, debugging results, or sharing your analysis with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Don’t Just Click and Run\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it might be tempting to simply run all the cells in order, that’s not the goal here. The real aim is to help you **understand** what each tool does, and **when** it’s appropriate to use it. Once you’ve mastered this, you’ll be in control of your own analysis — not just clicking through code, but making informed biological decisions."

    "### Pre-processing steps\n",
    "Before starting this notebook, your IMC data should already have gone through a series of **preprocessing steps**. These steps are often handled by the bioimaging facility or a dedicated pipeline, and they take care of many of the more technical and time-consuming tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exract raw images from MCD file** using [readimc](https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/readimc)\n",
    "- **Denoising** using the [IMC-Denoise](https://github.com/PENGLU-WashU/IMC_Denoise) algorithm to clean up raw image data and reduce noise.\n",
    "- **Cell segmentation** using [Cellpose (currently version 3)](https://github.com/MouseLand/cellpose), which identifies the boundaries of individual cells in the tissue images based on intensity and morphology, creating segmentation masks.\n",
    "- **Cell table generation**, which creates a per-cell dataset summarizing:\n",
    "  - Mean expression levels of each marker over the cells area *(as defined by the mask)*\n",
    "  - Spatial coordinates of cells in the tissue *(the centre of the mask)*\n",
    "  - Morphological details like cell area or shape\n",
    "- **Marker expression normalisation**, this is usually the **99th or 99.9th percentile**, depending on the size of the dataset. You can check in `pipeline/config.yaml --> segmentation --> marker normalisation`\n",
    "- **Creation of raw [AnnData object](#Working-with-AnnData-objects)** (`anndata.h5ad`) using the normalised marker expression and any sample-level meta data supplied in `metadata/dictionary.csv`\n",
    "- **Batch normalisation, UMAP creation and initial leiden clustering** to create a ready-to-analyse AnnData (`anndata_processed.h5ad`)\n",

    "### 📦 *\"What Does It Mean to Import a Package?\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a **package** is a collection of pre-written code that adds specific functionality to your project—like reading files, analyzing data, or creating plots. Instead of writing everything from scratch, you can **import** a package and use the tools it provides.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to work with data tables, you might use the `pandas` package. To use it in your code, you first need to import it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This tells Python:  \n",
    "> “Make the `pandas` package available in this notebook, and call it `pd` from now on.”\n",

    "📘 [Scanpy Documentation](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧱 `anndata`  \n",
    "AnnData is the data structure that Scanpy (and similar tools) use to store your entire dataset. It keeps everything together: your main data matrix (e.g., marker intensities), cell metadata (like cluster labels), feature info (like marker names), and dimensionality reduction coordinates (like UMAP). You won’t usually manipulate `AnnData` directly, but it's the foundation Scanpy builds on.\n",
    "\n",
    "📘 [AnnData Documentation](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔢 `numpy`  \n",

    "\n",
    "#### 📊 `pandas`  \n",
    "Pandas is Python's go-to tool for handling data tables (similar to Excel or R's dataframes). It makes it easy to filter, summarize, reshape, and analyze tabular data. It’s especially useful for working with metadata—like cluster labels, sample IDs, and anything in `adata.obs`.\n",

    "\n",
    "**UMAP** (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a dimensionality reduction technique. It helps us take high-dimensional data—like dozens of protein markers per cell—and project it down into **2D space**, where similar cells cluster together.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is incredibly useful for **visualizing complex datasets**, like Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) data, and spotting patterns, clusters, or outliers in the data.\n",

    "## <font color=green>Performing a Backgating Assessment with `backgating_assessment()`\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color=green>Why do we need to do backgating?\n",
    "\n",
    "When clustering cell populations using single-cell techniques like Scanpy, we rely solely on the mean cellular expression of each marker to group cells into types. However, we lose the visual context (what those cells looked like in the original image), and whether their morphology and surrounding tissue makes sense for their assigned type.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s where backgating comes in. Backgating is a crucial validation step that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Samples cells from each assigned population\n",
    "- Reconstructs their context in the original image\n",
    "- Overlays optional segmentation masks\n",
    "- Helps visually confirm if cells look correct to expert users (e.g., a CD3⁺ T cell should “look like” one)\n",
    "\n",
    "This builds trust in the data and helps catch annotation or segmentation issues early (before reviewers do!).\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color=green>What does `backgating_assessment` do?\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is a high-level utility that orchestrates the full backgating pipeline. It:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Computes population-level marker expression** (if needed)  \n",
    "   - The function can compute the mean expression of every marker per population and save it to a “mean expression” CSV (e.g., `markers_mean_expression.csv`).  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Selects top markers per population** (or lets you override them) \n",
    "   - By default, the function can pick the **top N** markers for each population (where N can be 1, 2, or 3) and automatically assign them to R/G/B channels for easy visualization.\n",
    "   - You can override any channel with a user-specified marker (e.g., `specify_red='CD3'`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ***Assigns markers to RGB channels** for visualization and **Clips and rescales intensities** based on global or per-ROI statistics\n",
    "   - It can create or update a “backgating settings” CSV (e.g., `backgating_settings.csv`) that records which markers are displayed in Red, Green, and Blue channels, as well as optional intensity range settings for each population. This can then be edited on disk to adjust the settings for how to decide the minimum and maximum values for each channel, for reach populations. Numeric values (ie, absolute numbers) corrspond to pixel values (ie, counts for IMC). However, we can also use various quartile settings to automatically calculate values:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **`\"q0.97\"`**: Use the *mean* of the 97th-percentile intensities across all ROIs.\n",
    "   - **`\"i0.97\"`**: Each ROI is clipped to its own 97th-percentile (so every ROI has potentially different max).\n",
    "   - **`\"m0.97\"`**: Use the *minimum* of the 97th-percentile intensities across ROIs.\n",
    "   - **`\"x0.97\"`**: Use the *maximum* of the 97th-percentile intensities across ROIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "   > After clipping, intensities are automatically **rescaled** so the new minimum and maximum become `0` and `1`, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Samples cells from each population**\n",
    "   - For each population (in `pop_obs`), you can specify a number of cells to sample (e.g., 50 per population).  \n",
    "   - The function extracts these cells’ coordinates and uses them to create small “thumbnails” from your raw image data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Overlays cells on images** (with optional segmentation masks) and **Creates visual thumbnail galleries** and overview images\n",
    "   - Internally, it calls a helper function (e.g., `backgating`) that loads/creates composite images of each ROI.  \n",
    "   - **Masks (Optional)**: If provided, the function can look for segmentation masks in a user-specified folder (or from a CSV mapping ROI->mask file) and overlay boundary lines around the center cell in each thumbnail.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Final Output**  \n",
    "   - A set of **PNG images** showing each selected cell (thumbnails).  \n",
    "   - An **overview** image per ROI with bounding boxes for each cell, if you choose.  \n",
    "   - Two **CSV files**: one for mean expression (if computed), and another for the final backgating settings (marker assignments, intensity ranges, etc.).  \n",
    "   - A **`cells_list.csv`** showing which cells were plotted in the thumbnails.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run it in different **modes**:\n",
    "- `'full'`: Compute mean expression, generate marker settings, and produce images.\n",
    "- `'save_markers'`: Just compute and save settings (no imaging).\n",
    "- `'load_markers'`: Load previously saved settings and generate images only.\n",
    "\n",
    "## <font color=green>Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start with `'save_markers'` mode to check which markers are being used.\n",
    "- Edit the `backgating_settings.csv` manually if needed (e.g., to fine-tune marker intensity ranges).\n",
    "- Always inspect the thumbnail and overview images to visually validate the clustering results.\n",
    "- Use segmentation masks when possible—they’re critical for confirming cell boundaries.\n",
    "- Adjust quantile settings for `min/max` if the intensity scaling looks off.\n",
    "\n",
    "## <font color=green>Outputs\n",
    "\n",

    "## <font color=blue>Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we cover the key tools and strategies you can use to cluster and assign cells to populations. If you have received this data with preprocssing already done, then some initial clustering will have already been done for you to get you started. Clustering is a core part of the IMC analysis workflow and allows you to group similar cells together based on their molecular profiles (in this case, protein expression).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple aspects covered, including:\n",
    "- Performing a completely new round of clustering from the raw data.\n",
    "- Subclustering existing populations to reveal finer substructure.\n",
    "- Merging or editing existing clusters based on prior knowledge or clustering results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color=blue>How Clustering Works in AnnData\n",
    "\n",
    "All clustering results are stored in the **AnnData object**, typically in the `.obs` attribute. This is a **table (like a DataFrame)** where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Each row** corresponds to a single cell.\n",
    "- **Each column** holds metadata about that cell — such as:\n",
    "  - What patient it came from\n",
    "  - What Region of Interest (ROI) it came from\n",
    "  - What **cluster** it belongs to\n",
    "\n",
    "When you perform clustering, you either generate a **new column in `.obs`** (e.g. `leiden_1.0`, `louvain_clusters`) or **overwrite an existing one**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of `.obs` as your master record of each cell's identity and annotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color=blue>When and Why to Rerun Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "You might want to:\n",
    "- Improve resolution by adjusting parameters (e.g., `resolution` in Leiden).\n",
    "- Refine populations by subsetting specific cell types.\n",
    "- Compare clustering approaches to assess stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color=blue>Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "- Always record which parameters you used (resolution, method, embedding).\n",
    "- Name your cluster columns clearly (e.g., `leiden_1.0_subclust_immune`) to avoid confusion. It is easy to lose track when you have several rounds of subclustering or merging exactly how you got to your final populations.\n",
    "- Consider saving `adata.obs` to CSV regularly to track changes or debug.\n",

    "\n",
    "Leiden clustering is one of the most commonly used community detection algorithms in single-cell analysis. In the context of Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC), we use it to assign each cell to a group (or population) based on similarity in marker expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color=blue>What is `sc.tl.leiden`?\n",
    "\n",
    "`sc.tl.leiden()` is a Scanpy function that performs **Leiden community detection** on a graph representation of your data. This groups cells that are similar to each other in a low-dimensional space — typically after PCA and neighborhood graph construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color=blue>Key Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- `resolution`: Controls the number of clusters. Higher values → more clusters.\n",
    "- `key_added`: Name for the new column in `adata.obs`. Use clear, descriptive names.\n",
    "- `n_neighbors`, `n_pcs`: These affect the neighborhood graph. You can tune them for better results depending on your data, but I often leave these alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color=blue>Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "- Track your versions: always give new cluster labels a unique name (e.g. `'leiden_0.5'`, `'leiden_subclust_CD8s'`), unless you want to over write an old cluster.\n",
    "- Use all the plotting tools to QC your clusters.\n",
    "- Experiment with different resolutions to find the one that best captures biological meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color=blue>Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "- Too few clusters? Try increasing `resolution` or check your `n_neighbors`.\n",
    "- Noisy results? Consider filtering cells, scaling properly, or reducing `n_pcs`.\n",
    "- Bizzarely, although leiden numbers the populations, they are actually stored as strings!\n",

    "## <font color=blue>Subclustering Using `sc.tl.leiden`\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, after your initial clustering, you may notice that one or more populations still appear heterogeneous. Subclustering allows you to focus on a subset of cells (e.g., a single population) and apply the clustering algorithm again, revealing finer substructure. This is commonly used to explore diversity within broad populations, e.g within T cells or myeloid groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color=blue>How to Subcluster\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Scanpy**, subclustering can be performed without subsetting the entire `AnnData` object. Instead, you can use the `restrict_to` argument in `sc.tl.leiden`, which restricts clustering to specific groups within an `.obs` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color=blue>*Example*\n",
    "In the example below, we are performing subclustering on the population `'5'` from the clustering `'leiden_0.3'` column in `adata.obs`. The results are saved in `adata.obs` under the column indicated by `key_added`, in this case `'myeloid_subclust'`. Helpfully, all the labels from the original clustering (in this case, `'leiden_0.3'`) that we didn't subcluster on get transferred over into the new column. This may sound hard to get your head around, but its fairly intuitive once you start using it."

    "\n",

As an example, lets say that based upon the marker expression from out heatmap, we think that leiden population `1` is exhausted CD8 T-cells. We could use the `'population'` column to assign very specific population names to the numbered leiden populations (e.g. 'Exhausted CD8 T cells'), perhaps population_broad is slightly less granular (e.g. 'CD8 T cells'), and hierarchy could be very broad (e.g. 'Lymphocytes'). If we think that several of the leiden clusters are actually the same bioloigcal population, and want to merge them, all we need to do is give them the same name in the table for that column, and all those cells will be assigned to the same group"
