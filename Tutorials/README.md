# Tutorials
Tutorials for other modalities will be added, currently there is a suggested pipeline for analysing IMC data.

## IMC v2
This is the pipeline for IMC analysis that uses the outputs of original Bodenmiller pipeline (https://bodenmillergroup.github.io/ImcSegmentationPipeline/), or Steinpose (https://github.com/guiwitz/napari-steinpose)

## IMC v3
This is a work in process where I will be incorporating denoising and segmentation using CellPose 2.0
